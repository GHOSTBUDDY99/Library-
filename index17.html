<div id="software">
<h3>10Q:- Describe the software are explaining? </h3>

<p>
    Ans:- software is that part of the computer the enables the hardware to operate software can be defined as a set of instructions  are given to the computer with which the computer processes data(input) and gives information( output) . these set of instruction also are called programs.
<br><br>
Software can be broadly classified into two categories:
<br>
i)	System Software
<br>
ii)	Application Software
<br>
iii) Utility software

</p>
<p>
    <h3>System Software</h3>System software are computer programs that run a computer system itself or assist in running application programs. System software are hardware oriented i.e. they are designed in a way so as take maximum advantage of the available hardware resources. 
For example- operating system, Language translators.

</p>
<p>
    <h3>Application Software</h3> Application Software are computer programs that  user oriented . They are designed to accomplish specific user tasks such as helping to write letter, drawings , calculating , accounting , payroll, etc.
For  example:- word processor, spreadsheets.
</p>
<h3>Utility software</h3>
<p>Utility software is software designed to help analyze, configure, optimize or maintain a computer.[1] It is used to support the computer infrastructure - in contrast to application software, which is aimed at directly performing tasks that benefit ordinary users. However, utilities often form part of the application systems. For example, a batch job may run user-written code to update a database and may then include a step that runs a utility to back up the database, or a job may run a utility to compress a disk before copying files. Eg - Anti Virus</p>

<!-----------Memory-->
<div id="memory">
<h3>11Q:-What types of Memory? Explain.</h3>
<p>
    Ans:- Three types of Memory-
    <br>
a)	Primary Memory
<br>
b) Secondary Memory
<br>
c) Cache Memory
<h4>Primary Memory</h4>
<p>Primary memory is a segment of computer memory that can be accessed directly by the processor. In a hierarchy of memory, primary memory have access time less than secondary memory and greater than cache memory. Generally, primary memory has a storage capacity lesser than secondary memory and greater than cache memory.</p>
</p>
<h4>Secondary Memory</h4>

<p>In a computer, memory refers to the physical devices that are used to store programs or data on a temporary or permanent basis. It is a group of registers. Memory are of two types (i) primary memory, (ii) secondary memory. Primary memory is made up of semiconductors, It is also divided into two types, Read-Only Memory (ROM) and Random Access Memory (RAM). Secondary memory is a physical device for the permanent storage of programs and data(Hard disk, Compact disc, Flash drive, etc.).</p>
<h4>Cache Memory</h4>
<p>Cache Memory is a special very high-speed memory. It is used to speed up and synchronizing with high-speed CPU. Cache memory is costlier than main memory or disk memory but economical than CPU registers. Cache memory is an extremely fast memory type that acts as a buffer between RAM and the CPU. It holds frequently requested data and instructions so that they are immediately available to the CPU when needed.</p>
</div>

<h3>12Q:- Describe the Classification of Computer?</h3>
<p>
    Ans:- The computer classification are depending on their speed , cost , Size and their storage capacity as follows-

    <h4>Micro Computer</h4>
	
    Micro Computer is called a PC (Personal Computer). It is a small computer that is very economical in cost. A typical micro computer has a keyboard for input as screen and a printer for output and one or two disk drive for secondary storage. The most widely known micro computer made by IBM. 
<br>
    <h4>Mini Computer</h4>
	Medium sized computer are commonly called mini computers. These computers usually have several terminals for input and a printer for output, one or more disk drive for axon diary storage. Minicomputers have a grater storage capacity and are faster than micro computer.

<br>   
<h4> Mainframe Computer</h4>

	A mainframe computer has many terminals a serial printers, and several disk and tape drivers, these types of computer can process several programs can currently and can be used many people at one time.

   <h3>Operating System</h3>
   <p>
    3.1. Introduction to operating system
    <br><br>
It is a set of software program. It provides an interface between the user and computer hardware. It controls and operates CPU, Memory, Storage and all the attached devices. It provides a platform for running application software.  Examples: MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows, Linux, UNIX, etc.
<br>
3.2. Types of operating system
<br><br>
The operating systems are classified on the basis of interface and user / tasks basis. Types of operating system are as follows:
BASED ON INTERFACE
<br><br>
1.	Graphical User Interface (GUI) Operating system: It is a multi tasking operating system. GUI allows users to interact with the computer system using icons, images and graphical representation instead of using text commands. It allows users to work in more than one application simultaneously. Example – Microsoft windows, OS/2, MAC OS, etc.
<br><br>
2.	Character User Interface (CUI) Operating system: CUI system uses commands to operate the computer system and it has no graphical content, icons, images as GUI operating system. There is no use of mouse or other similar devices in CUI system. Example – MS-DOS, UNIX.
<br><br>
USER BASED/TASK BASED
<br><br>
1.	Single task Operating system: In these types of operating system, only one user can operate and only single task can be performed at a time. Example – MS-DOS. 
<br><br>
2.	Multi-tasking operating system: In this type of operating system, an user can perform multiple tasks at a time. For example, if user is typing a document during the same time user can also enjoy listening music, printing, etc. Example – Microsoft Windows, LINUX.
<br><br>
3.	Multi-user Operating system: multi-user operating system can be operated by more than one user at the same time. It can also execute more than task at the same time. Example – Windows NT, MVS, UNIX. 
<br><br>
4.	Graphical User Interface (GUI) Operating system: It is a multi tasking operating system. GUI allows users to interact with the computer system using icons, images and graphical representation instead of using text commands. It allows users to work in more than one application simultaneously. Example – Microsoft windows, OS/2, MAC OS, etc.

<br><br>
3.3	About Windows
<br><br>
WINDOWS: Windows operating system is developed by Microsoft and therefore it is known as MS-Windows. Microsoft windows are a graphical user interface (GUI) operating system. In November 1985 Microsoft has launched its first operating system named as Windows 1.01, till date Microsoft has updated different versions of windows. At present windows 7 and windows 8 are the newer versions of Microsoft Windows. Among which Windows 7 is the popular one and widely used operating system. Some of the windows versions are:
<br>
i.	Windows 2000 
<br>

<!-------------Features of Computer-->
<div id="features">
    <h3>FEATURES OF THE COMPUTER </h3>
    <b>Speed</b>:- The Smallest unit of time , the second is long enough for the computer to perform a dozen tasks. Generally a computer takes about 1/106 of a second to carry out one instruction. For example, a powerful computer could perform three million calculations in a second, involving the addition of say two 18 digit numbers.
<br><br>
   <b> Accuracy</b>:- The computer is very accurate. Almost without exception, the errors in computing are due to human rather than technological weaknesses.
<br><br>
  <b>  Versatility</b>:-Computer seems capable of performing almost any task provided to it and that task can be broken down into a series of logical steps.
<br><br>
  <b>  Automation</b>:- You can do almost any work repetitively. The Computer executes the instructions automatically without any human intervention and can perform diverse tasks simultaneously.
<br><br>
   <b> Diligence</b>:-Being machine, a computer dose not suffer from the human traits of tiredness and lack of concentration. If 3 million calculations have to be performed, it will perform the 3 millionth instructions with exactly the same accuracy and speed as the first.
<br><br>
    <b>Storage</b>:- The Computer has an enormous capacity for data storage which can be retrieved very quickly.
</div>
<!----------History of Computer-->
<div id="history">
<h3>HISTORY OF COMPUTER </h3>
<p>
    The history of computers starts out about 2000 years ago, at the birth of the abacus a wooden rack holding two horizontal wires with beads strung on them. Hen these beads are moved around, according to programming rules memorized by the user, all regular arithmetic problems can be done. Another important invention around the same time was the astrolabe use for navigation.
	Blasé Pascal is usually created for building the first digital computer in 1642. It added numbers entered with dials and was made to help his father, a tax collector. In 1671, Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz invented a computer that was built in 1694. It could add, and after changing some things around, multiply.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Advances in the 1950’s:-  </b>
	Early in the 50’s two important engineering discoveries changed the image of the electronic computer field, from one of fast but unreliable hardware to an image of relatively high reliability and even more capability. These discoveries were the magnetic core memory and the Transistor Circuit Element. These technical discoveries quickly found their way into new models of digital computers.
  <br>
  <b> Advances in the 1960’s:-</b>  
	Early in the 60’s, efforts to design and develop and fastest possible computer with the greatest capacity reached a turning point with the LARC machine.
More Recent Advances:-  
<br>	
The trend during the 1970’s was to some extent, moving away from very powerful, single purpose computers and toward a large range of applications for cheaper computer systems.
	A new revolution in computer hardware was under way, involving shrinking of computer logic circuitry and of components by what are called large-scale integration (LSI) techniques.
	In the 1980’s, Very large scale integration (VLSI) in which hundreds of thousands of new to the computer field, introduced in the 1970s programmable minicomputers supplied with (PC’s), which are programmable machines small enough and inexpensive enough to be purchased and used by individuals.

 <u> CPU – Central Processing Unit</u>
 <br>
Central Processing Unit or the CPU, is the brain of the computer. It works the same way a human brain works. As the brain controls all human activities, the CPU too controls all tasks.

Moreover, the CPU conducts all the arithmetical and logical operations in the computer.

Now the CPU comprises of two units, namely – ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) and CU (Control Unit). Both of these units work in sync. The CPU processes the data as a whole.
<br><br>
<u>ALU – Arithmetic Logic Unit</u>
<br>
The Arithmetic Logic Unit is made of two terms, arithmetic and logic. There are two major functions that this unit performs.

Data inserted through the input unit into the primary memory. Performs the basic arithmetical operation on it. Like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It performs all sorts of calculations required on the data. Then sends back data to the storage.
The unit is also responsible for performing logical operations like, AND, OR, Equal to, Less than, etc.  In addition to this it conducts merging, sorting, and selection of the given data.
<br><br>
<u>CU – Control Unit</u>
<br>
The control unit as the name suggests is the controller of all the activities/tasks and operations. All this is performed inside the computer.
The memory unit sends a set of instructions to the control unit. Then the control unit in turn converts those instructions. After that these instructions are converted to control signals.

<!-----------Computer Number System-->
<div id="number-system">
  <h3 class="form">NUMBER SYSTEM</h3>
  <p>
    When we type some letters or words, the computer translates them in numbers as computers can understand only numbers. A computer can understand the positional number system where there are only a few symbols called digits and these symbols represent different values depending on the position they occupy in the number.
<br>
 The value of each digit in a number can be determined using −
<br><br>
1. The digit
<br>
2. The position of the digit in the number
<br>
3. The base of the number system (where the base is defined as the total number of digits available in the number system)
<br><br>
<u>Decimal Number System</u>
<br>
The number system that we use in our day-to-day life is the decimal number system. Decimal number system has base 10 as it uses 10 digits from 0 to 9. In decimal number system, the successive positions to the left of the decimal point represent units, tens, hundreds, thousands, and so on.

Each position represents a specific power of the base (10). For example, the decimal number 1234 consists of the digit 4 in the units position, 3 in the tens position, 2 in the hundreds position, and 1 in the thousands position. Its value can be written as
<br>
(1 x 1000)+ (2 x 100)+ (3 x 10)+ (4 x l)
<br>
(1 x 103)+ (2 x 102)+ (3 x 101)+ (4 x l00)
<br>
1000 + 200 + 30 + 4
<br>
1234
